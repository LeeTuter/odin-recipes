        <h3>Sizzling Skillet Chicken Fajitas</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite dishes to order when our family goes out for dinner is fajitas. It's one of the only dishes you can hear and smell before it hits the table. There is just something about getting a hot skillet full of sizzling meat and veggies that just amps up the enjoyment of a meal. Unfortunately, going out to dinner is more of an occasional event. So how can you bring that experience home to your family? You bust out your trusty cast iron skillet and make them yourself!</p>

        <p>It may seem like a daunting task, recreating the experience of a hot skillet full of delicious food and delivering it to a table, but the truth is it's much simpler than it looks! With the proper prep and understanding of the process anyone can knock this out of the park. It all starts with the cast iron skillet. While this can be done with any skillet you may have, it really can't be stressed enough how much of a difference a cast iron skillet makes. They can be had fairly <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Skillet-Pre-Seasoned-Ready-Stove/dp/B00006JSUA/ref=sr_1_3?crid=24ND7IGFETU4Y&keywords=lodge+cast+iron+skillet&nav_sdd=aps&qid=1674243709&refinements=p_n_feature_three_browse-bin%3A3085452011&rnid=3085449011&s=kitchen&sprefix=lodge+&sr=1-3" target="_blank">inexpensively</a> and are extremely versatile tools for the home cook. From cooking meals to baking desserts, these skillets a great addition to any kitchen.</p>

        <p>Now that I finished my cast iron spiel, we can talk about the fajitas themselves. Fajitas are simply grilled protein served with stripped peppers and onions, typically with flour or corn tortillas and any number of sides. Traditionally, fajitas were served with skirt steak but these days you can find any number of protein options. This recipe is for chicken fajitas, you but you could easily substitute steak, shrimp... or get crazy and use all three! Larger cuts of protein are traditionally cut into strips matching the peppers and onions. For sides, traditional options such as pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream are fan favorites but feel free to dress yours up however you want. Make sure you have plenty of lime to go around, as it provides the finishing touch of flair and flavor!</p>
