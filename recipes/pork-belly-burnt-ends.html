    <h3>Pork Belly Burnt Ends</h3>
    <p>Smoke pork belly burnt ends might be one of my favorite BBQ treats. Done right, they are like little pieces of meat candy. They make for great appetizers or game day snacks, as they are rich and filling. Serve them on a toothpick or on a bun for a delicious sandwich!</p>
